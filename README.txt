A plugin for serving 'security.txt' in WordPress 6.1.1+.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a security.txt file in the WordPress installation root.

You can edit/add to this file within the WordPress SecurityTXT settings page.

The purpose of the security.txt file is to allow users to properly disclose security vulnerabilities or bugs to you.

The [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) file is currently a draft "standard". This file is similar to the robots.txt file but for security. Large companies have already started to adopt this standard including Google, Facebook, GitHub, just to name a few.
