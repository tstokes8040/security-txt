# Security-TXT Plugin

This plugin creates a security.txt file in the WordPress installation root. You can edit/add to this file within the WordPress SecurityTXT settings page. The purpose of the security.txt file is to allow users to properly disclose security vulnerabilities or bugs to you. This is best practice and a standard.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
